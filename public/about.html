<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm originally from Seoul, South Korea, but I spent my formative years in the bustling city of Ilsan.
   In 2015, I embarked on a working holiday adventure to Australia, and it was there that 
   I discovered my deep affinity for the country's natural beauty and laid-back lifestyle.
</p>

<p>My journey into education began with a Bachelor of Primary Education back in Korea. 
However, my heart remained in Australia, and I returned to pursue a Master's degree in Early Childhood and Primary Education
 at Monash University. I proudly completed my studies in 2021 and have since been passionately serving as an early childhood teacher.

<p>In 2023, I embarked on a new adventure, one that saw me switch gears and dive headfirst into the world of web development. 
My fascination with computers and coding ignited in 2022, leading me to enroll in a computer science course. 
I've been relishing every moment of this new journey, particularly the thrill of coding in various languages. 
My ultimate passion lies in web development, and I am confident that I have the potential to excel in this field.
</p>

<p>Join me on my quest to explore the fascinating realm of web development, where I'm constantly learning and growing. 
Together, we can create digital wonders and leave our mark on the virtual landscape. 
Thanks for joining me on this exciting journey!
